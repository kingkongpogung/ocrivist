# Introduction #
Ocrivist makes it easy to scan and OCR books and other printed documents and then export them to PDF or Djvu format.
Ocrivist can be used on Linux or Windows and uses the Leptonica and Tesseract libraries.

The program uses freepascal bindings for [libtesseract](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) and the [Leptonica](http://www.leptonica.com/) library. These can be found in their own folders in the base folder of the SVN repository.

Future releases of Ocrivist can be found at [ocrivist.com](http://www.ocrivist.com/)
